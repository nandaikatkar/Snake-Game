# Snake-Game
The Snake game in Python is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake to eat food appearing randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats the food, it grows longer, making the game increasingly challenging as the snake's body becomes harder to navigate without colliding into itself or the walls.
